export const about = [
  `Hello, I'm a young (21) junior full-stack web developer from the
Czech Republic. I have a deep passion for the computer world, cars,
and historical facts.`,
  `My journey in the field of IT began when I was around 10 years old,
after receiving my very first computer. Since then, I have been
tinkering with it and constantly expanding my knowledge of how
computers work. In 2017, I enrolled in high school with a primary
focus on providing me with a solid foundation for a career in IT.`,
  `Initially, I doubted my abilities in the IT field, mainly due to my
struggles with mathematics, which had always been my arch-nemesis.
However, with time, I managed to overcome this challenge. Thanks to
distance education, I no longer felt embarrassed about giving wrong
answers, and I even discovered that I found topics like vectors and
combinatorics quite enjoyable.`,
  `Currently, I reside in a small district town with a population of
approximately 100,000 people. It's an old city located near the
borders of Austria and Germany. While it is my hometown, I aspire to
move to a larger city, preferably a global metropolis. I am fluent
in Czech, possess an English proficiency level of B2, and I am
currently in the process of learning German.`,
